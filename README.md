State Switch is a Monitor/Guard for Managing Your Async Operations.

## Introduction

`StateSwitch` can manage state transition for you, by switching from the following four states:

1. `OFF`: state is off
1. `pending ON`: state is switching from OFF to ON
1. `ON`: state is on
1. `pending OFF`: state is switch from ON to OFF

You can set/get the state with the API, and you can also monite the state switch events by listening the 'on' and 'off' events.

There have another `read()` API return a `Promise` so that you can wait the `on` of `off` events by:

```ts
await state.ready('on')
await state.ready('off')
```

If the state is already ON when you `await state.ready('on')`, then it will resolved immediatelly.

## EXAMPLE

Talk is cheap, show me the code!

### Code

```ts
import { StateSwitch } from 'state-switch'

function doSlowConnect() {
  console.log('> doSlowConnect() started')
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('> doSlowConnect() done')
      resolve()
    }, 1000)
  })
}

function doSlowDisconnect() {
  console.log('> doSlowDisconnect() started')
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('> doSlowDisconnect() done')
      resolve()
    }, 1000)
  })
}

class MyConnection {
  private state = new StateSwitch('MyConnection')

  constructor() {
    /* */
  }

  public connect() {
    /**
     * This is the only 1 Right State
     */
    if (this.state.off() === true) {
      this.state.on('pending')

      doSlowConnect().then(() => {
        this.state.on(true)
        console.log(`> I'm now opened`)
      })

      console.log(`> I'm opening`)
      return
    }

    /**
     * These are the other 3 Error States
     */
    if (this.state.off() === 'pending') {
      console.error(`> I'm closing, please wait`)
    } else if (this.state.on() === true) {
      console.error(`> I'm already open. no need to connect again`)
    } else if (this.state.on() === 'pending') {
      console.error(`> I'm opening, please wait`)
    }
  }

  public disconnect() {
    /**
     * This is the only one Right State
     */
    if (this.state.on() === true) {
      this.state.off('pending')

      doSlowDisconnect().then(() => {
        this.state.off(true)
        console.log(`> I'm closed.`)
      })

      console.log(`> I'm closing`)
      return
    }

    /**
     * These are the other 3 Error States
     */
    if (this.state.on() === 'pending') {
      console.error(`> I'm opening, please wait`)
    } else if (this.state.off() === true) {
      console.error(`> I'm already close. no need to disconnect again`)
    } else if (this.state.off() === 'pending') {
      console.error(`> I'm closing, please wait`)
    }
  }
}

const conn = new MyConnection()

console.log('CALL: conn.connect(): should start to opening')
conn.connect()

console.log('CALL: conn.connect(): should not connect again while opening')
conn.connect()

console.log('CALL: conn.disconnect(): can not disconnect while opening')
conn.disconnect()

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('... 2 seconds later, should be already open  ...')

  console.log('CALL: conn.connect(): should not connect again if we are open')
  conn.connect()

  console.log('CALL: conn.disconnect(): should start to closing')
  conn.disconnect()

  console.log('CALL: conn.disconnect(): should not disconnect again while we are closing')
  conn.disconnect()

  console.log('CALL: conn.connect(): can not do connect while we are closing')
  conn.connect()

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('... 2 seconds later, should be already closed ...')

    console.log('CALL: conn.disconnect(): should not disconnect again if we are close')
    conn.disconnect()
  }, 2000)

}, 2000)

```

### Diagram

What's the meaning of the above code?

StateSwitch helps you manage the following four states easy:

![State Switch Diagram](https://huan.github.io/state-switch/images/state-switch-diagram.png)

### Run

```shell
$ npm run demo

> state-switch@0.1.3 demo /home/zixia/git/state-switch
> ts-node example/demo

CALL: conn.connect(): should start to opening
> doSlowConnect() started
> I'm opening
CALL: conn.connect(): should not connect again while opening
> I'm opening, please wait
CALL: conn.disconnect(): can not disconnect while opening
> I'm opening, please wait
> doSlowConnect() done
> I'm now opened
... 2 seconds later, should be already open  ...
CALL: conn.connect(): should not connect again if we are open
> I'm already open. no need to connect again
CALL: conn.disconnect(): should start to closing
> doSlowDisconnect() started
> I'm closing
CALL: conn.disconnect(): should not disconnect again while we are closing
> I'm closing, please wait
CALL: conn.connect(): can not do connect while we are closing
> I'm closing, please wait
> doSlowDisconnect() done
> I'm closed.
... 2 seconds later, should be already closed ...
CALL: conn.disconnect(): should not disconnect again if we are close
> I'm already close. no need to disconnect again

```

That's the idea: **we should always be able to know the state of our async operation**.

## API REFERENCE

Class StateSwitch

### constructor(clientName?: string)

Create a new StateSwitch instance.

```ts
private state = new StateSwitch('MyConn')
```

### on(): boolean | 'pending'

Get the state for `ON`: `true` for ON(stable), `pending` for ON(in-process). `false` for not ON.

### on(state: true | 'pending'): void

Set the state for `ON`: `true` for ON(stable), `pending` for ON(in-process).

### off(): boolean | 'pending'

Get the state for `OFF`: `true` for OFF(stable), `pending` for OFF(in-process). `false` for not OFF.

### off(state: true | 'pending'): void

Set the state for `OFF`: `true` for OFF(stable), `pending` for OFF(in-process).

### pending(): boolean

Check if the state is `pending`.

`true` means there's some async operations we need to wait.
`false` means no async on fly.

### ready(expectedState='on', noCross=false): Promise<void>

1. `expectedState`: `'on' | 'off'`, default is `on`
1. `noCross`: `boolean`, default is `false`

Wait the expected state to be ready.

If set `noCross` to `true`, then `ready()` will throw if you are wait a state from it's opposite site, for example: you can expect an `Exception` when you call `ready('on', true)` when the `on() === 'off'`.

### name(): string

Get the name from the constructor.

### setLog(log: Brolog | Npmlog)

Enable log by set log to a Npmlog compatible instance.

Personaly I use Brolog, which is writen by my self, the same API with Npmlog but can also run inside Browser with Angular supported.

```ts
const log = Brolog.instance()
StateSwitch.setLog(log)
```

## CHANGELOG

### master v0.15

Publish as ESM package.

### v0.14

1. Add RxJS typing unit tests for making sure that the `fromEvent` typing inference is right.

### v0.9 master (Mar 2020)

Support for using RxJS:

```ts
const notPending = (state: true | 'pending') => state === true

const stateOn$ = fromEvent(stateSwitch, 'on').pipe(
  filter(notPending)
)
```

See: [RxJS - operator - fromEvent - Node.js EventEmitter: An object with addListener and removeListener methods.](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/fromEvent)

1. Support emit `on` and `off` events with the args of the `state` of two values: `true` and `pending`.
1. Add events unit tests

### v0.6 (Jun 2018)

1. DevOps for publishing to NPM@next for odd minor versions.
1. Add State Diagram for easy understanding what state-switch do

### v0.4 (Apr 2018)

BREAKING CHANGE: Change the `ready()` parameter to the opposite side.

* Before: `ready(state, crossWait=false)`
* AFTER: `ready(state, noCross=false`)

### v0.3 (Apr 2018)

1. add new method `ready()` to let user wait until the expected state is on(true).

### v0.2 (Oct 2017)

BREAKING CHANGES: redesigned all APIs.

1. delete all old APIs.
1. add 4 new APIs: on() / off() / pending() / name()

### v0.1.0 (May 2017)

Rename to `StateSwitch` because the name StateMonitor on npmjs.com is taken.

1. Make it a solo NPM Module. ([#466](https://github.com/Chatie/wechaty/issues/466))

### v0.0.0 (Oct 2016)

Orignal name is `StateMonitor`

1. Part of the [Wechaty](https://github.com/Chatie/wechaty) project
